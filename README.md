Package for Unity that enables two-way data binding between Unity UIElements and game/business logic code. 

This reduces boiler-plate code that would otherwise be necessary for things like updating the UI when a property changes, 

removes the need for messy links between objects in the scene that can be broken easily, and allows easier unit testing of code by providing a layer of abstraction between the UI and your core logic code.

## Installation

The easiest way to install is to download and open the [Installer Package](https://package-installer.glitch.me/v1/installer/OpenUPM/net.battlehub.uielementbindings?registry=https%3A%2F%2Fpackage.openupm.com&scope=net.battlehub)

It runs a script that installs Package Utils via a scoped registry.

Afterwards Package Utils is listed in the Package Manager (under My Registries) and can be installed and updated from there.
